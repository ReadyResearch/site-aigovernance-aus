      title: About SARA
      text: |-
        The **Survey Assessing Risks from AI (SARA)** is an annual representative survey of Australian adults investigating:

        - Public perceptions of AI risks (from current harms to potential catastrophic risks)
        - Support for AI development and regulation
        - Priority governance actions to address AI risks

        SARA generates 'evidence for action' to help public and private actors make informed decisions about safer AI development and use.

        This project is a collaboration between Ready Research and The University of Queensland.
