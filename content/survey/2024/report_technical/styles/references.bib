  title     = "Trust in Artificial Intelligence: Australian Insights",
  author    = "Lockey, Steven and Gillespie, Nicole and Curtis, Caitlin",
  abstract  = "This report publishes the findings of the first Australian
               nation-wide survey looking at public attitude and trust in
               artificial intelligence (AI) systems. This national survey is
               the first to take a deep dive into answering this question and
               understanding community trust and expectations in relation to
               AI. To do this, we surveyed a nationally representative sample
               of over 2,500 Australian citizens in June to July 2020. Our
               findings provide important and timely research insights into the
               public's trust and attitudes towards AI and lay out a pathway
               for strengthening trust and acceptance of AI systems. Below, we
               summarise the key findings. In the conclusion to the report, we
               draw out the implications of these insights for government,
               business and NGOs. Abstract/Description Artificial Intelligence
               (AI) is the cornerstone technology of the Fourth Industrial
               Revolution and is enabling rapid innovation with many potential
               benefits for Australian society (e.g. enhanced healthcare
               diagnostics, transportation optimisation) and business (e.g.
               enhanced efficiency and competitiveness). The COVID-19 pandemic
               has accelerated the uptake of advanced technology, and
               investment in AI continues to grow exponentially. AI also poses
               considerable risks and challenges to society which raises
               concerns about whether AI systems are worthy of trust. These
               concerns have been fuelled by high profile cases of AI use that
               were biased, discriminatory, manipulative, unlawful, or violated
               privacy or other human rights. Without public confidence that AI
               is being developed and used in an ethical and trustworthy
               manner, it will not be trusted and its full potential will not
               be realised. To echo the sentiment of Dr Alan Finkel AO,
               Australia's Chief Scientist, acceptance of AI rests on ``the
               essential foundation of trust''. Are we capable of extending our
               trust to AI? This national survey is the first to take a deep
               dive into answering this question and understanding community
               trust and expectations in relation to AI. To do this, we
               surveyed a nationally representative sample of over 2,500
               Australian citizens in June to July 2020. Our findings provide
               important and timely research insights into the public's trust
               and attitudes towards AI and lay out a pathway for strengthening
               trust and acceptance of AI systems. Key findings include: -
               Trust is central to the acceptance of AI, and is influenced by
               four key drivers; - Australians have low trust in AI systems but
               generally `accept' or `tolerate' AI; - Australians expect AI to
               be regulated and carefully managed; - Australians expect
               organisations to uphold the principles of trustworthy AI; -
               Australians feel comfortable with some but not all uses of AI at
               work; - Australians want to know more about AI but currently
               have low awareness and understanding of AI and its uses. We draw
               out the implications of the findings for government, business
               and NGOs and provide a roadmap to enhancing public trust in AI
               highlighting three key actions: - Live up to Australian's
               expectations of trustworthy AI - Strengthen the regulatory
               framework for governing AI - Strengthen Australia's AI literacy",

  abstract    = "In the next few decades we may develop AI that can automate
                 ~all cognitive tasks and dramatically transform the world. By
                 contrast, today the capabilities and impact of AI are much
                 more limited. Once we have AI that could readily automate 20\%
                 of cognitive tasks (weighted by 2020 economic value), how much
                 longer until it can automate 100\%? This is what I refer to as
                 the question of AI takeoff speeds; this report develops a
                 compute-centric framework for answering it. First, I estimate
                 how much more ``effective compute'' -- a measure that combines
                 compute with the quality of AI algorithms -- is needed to
                 train AI that could readily perform 100\% of tasks compared to
                 AI that could just perform 20\% of tasks; my best-guess is 4
                 orders of magnitude more (i.e. 10,000X as much). Then, using a
                 computational semi-endogenous growth model, I simulate how
                 long it will take for the effective compute used in the
                 largest training run to increase by this amount: the model's
                 median prediction is just 3 years. The simulation models the
                 effect of both rising human investments and increasing AI
                 automation on AI R\&D progress.",

  abstract      = "Advanced AI models hold the promise of tremendous benefits
                   for humanity, but society needs to proactively manage the
                   accompanying risks. In this paper, we focus on what we term
                   ``frontier AI'' models: highly capable foundation models
                   that could possess dangerous capabilities sufficient to pose
                   severe risks to public safety. Frontier AI models pose a
                   distinct regulatory challenge: dangerous capabilities can
                   arise unexpectedly; it is difficult to robustly prevent a
                   deployed model from being misused; and, it is difficult to
                   stop a model's capabilities from proliferating broadly. To
                   address these challenges, at least three building blocks for
                   the regulation of frontier models are needed: (1)
                   standard-setting processes to identify appropriate
                   requirements for frontier AI developers, (2) registration
                   and reporting requirements to provide regulators with
                   visibility into frontier AI development processes, and (3)
                   mechanisms to ensure compliance with safety standards for
                   the development and deployment of frontier AI models.
                   Industry self-regulation is an important first step.
                   However, wider societal discussions and government
                   intervention will be needed to create standards and to
                   ensure compliance with them. We consider several options to
                   this end, including granting enforcement powers to
                   supervisory authorities and licensure regimes for frontier
                   AI models. Finally, we propose an initial set of safety
                   standards. These include conducting pre-deployment risk
                   assessments; external scrutiny of model behavior; using risk
                   assessments to inform deployment decisions; and monitoring
                   and responding to new information about model capabilities
                   and uses post-deployment. We hope this discussion
                   contributes to the broader conversation on how to balance
                   public safety risks and innovation benefits from advances at
                   the frontier of AI development.",

  title    = "Tort Law as a Tool for Mitigating Catastrophic Risk from
              Artificial Intelligence",
  author   = "Weil, Gabriel",
  abstract = "The capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) systems have
              improved markedly over the past decade. This rapid progress has
              brought greater attention to longstanding concerns that advanced
              AI systems could cause catastrophic harm, up to and including
              human extinction. In principle, the prospect of tort liability
              could encourage AI developers to proceed with caution. But the
              current U.S. tort liability system is not set up to handle the
              catastrophic risk posed by AI --- since most of the expected harm
              from AI systems comes in truly catastrophic scenarios where
              compensation would not be feasible. To address this, I propose a
              form of punitive damages designed to pull forward this expected
              liability into cases of practically compensable harm. To succeed
              in offering sufficient incentives for precaution, such punitive
              damages would need to be available even in the absence of human
              malice or recklessness. This paper also examines other legal
              mechanisms to ensure socially optimal investment in AI safety
              measures. Doctrinal changes considered include recognizing the
              training and deployment of advanced AI systems as an abnormally
              dangerous activity subject to strict liability, adopting a
              capacious concept of foreseeability for the purposes of
              evaluating proximate cause in cases of AI harm, and modifying the
              scope of legally compensable damages in cases involving loss of
              human life. The paper also discusses further AI liability law
              changes that would require legislation, including requiring
              liability insurance for training and deployment of advanced AI
              systems, diverting a portion of punitive damages into an AI
              safety fund, and credibly announcing the availability of strict
              liability and punitive damages in advance of the first case in
              which they might be appropriate. The paper concludes by
              characterizing the limits of an ex post tort liability framework
              for limiting catastrophic AI risk and considers what
              complementary policies may be needed to plug the gaps left by
              such a framework.",

                   all tasks in 45 years and of automating all human jobs in
                   120 years, with Asian respondents expecting these dates much
                   sooner than North Americans. These results will inform
