        **2024 Survey** (1,141 Australians): Australians are most concerned about AI risks where AI acts unsafely, is misused, or displaces jobs. They judge **"preventing dangerous and catastrophic outcomes from AI"** the **#1 priority for the Australian Government in AI**; 9 in 10 Australians support creating a new regulatory body for AI.

        The majority of Australians (8 in 10) support the statement that "mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war".

      text: |-
        **Strong public mandate for action**: With 9 in 10 Australians supporting a new regulatory body for AI, and "preventing dangerous and catastrophic outcomes from AI" rated as the top government priority, there is overwhelming public support for robust AI governance.

        **Risk awareness is broad**: Australians recognize diverse AI risks—from current harms like misinformation and job displacement to potential catastrophic outcomes. This comprehensive risk awareness supports a governance framework that addresses both near-term and long-term challenges.

        **Global perspective**: The strong support (8 in 10 Australians) for treating AI extinction risk as a global priority alongside pandemics and nuclear war shows public understanding that AI governance requires international cooperation and serious attention.
