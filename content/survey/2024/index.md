        Understanding Australian public views on AI risks and governance
        <br>
        We conduct representative surveys of Australian adults to understand public perceptions of AI risks and support for AI governance actions in Australia.

        **2024 Survey** (1,141 Australians): Australians are most concerned about AI risks where AI acts unsafely, is misused, or displaces jobs. They judge **"preventing dangerous and catastrophic outcomes from AI"** the **#1 priority for the Australian Government in AI**; 9 in 10 Australians support creating a new regulatory body for AI.

        The majority of Australians (8 in 10) support the statement that "mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war".

        **2025 Survey** (933 Australians): Australians expect AI to be as safe as commercial aviation - at least **4,000x** safer than current risk estimates. They want the government to better manage AI risks, and many risk controls would increase their trust in AI.

      text: |-
        These findings provide clear direction for AI governance in Australia:

        **Strong public mandate for action**: With 9 in 10 Australians supporting a new regulatory body for AI, and "preventing dangerous and catastrophic outcomes from AI" rated as the top government priority, there is overwhelming public support for robust AI governance.

        **Risk awareness is broad**: Australians recognize diverse AI risks—from current harms like misinformation and job displacement to potential catastrophic outcomes. This comprehensive risk awareness supports a governance framework that addresses both near-term and long-term challenges.

        **Global perspective**: The strong support (8 in 10 Australians) for treating AI extinction risk as a global priority alongside pandemics and nuclear war shows public understanding that AI governance requires international cooperation and serious attention.

        These results demonstrate that the Australian public is ready for substantive policy action on AI safety and governance.

      title: How We Conducted This Survey
      text: |-

        Understanding public beliefs and expectations about artificial intelligence (AI) risks and their possible responses is important for ensuring that the ethical, legal, and social implications of AI are addressed through effective governance.

        We conduct the *Survey Assessing Risks from AI* (SARA) to generate 'evidence for action', to help public and private actors make the decisions needed for safer AI development and use.

        Our surveys investigate public concerns about diverse risks from AI, from AI being used to spread fake and harmful content online, to AI being used for the creation of biological and chemical weapons; public support for AI development and regulation; and priority governance actions to address risks from AI (with a focus on government action).

        **2025 Survey:** We recruited 933 Australians through online representative quota sampling stratified by age, sex, and Australian state / territory.

        **2024 Survey:** We recruited 1,141 Australians through online representative quota sampling stratified by age, sex, and Australian state / territory. We also conducted multilevel regression with poststratification to construct more accurate population estimates based on 2021 Australian Census data.
