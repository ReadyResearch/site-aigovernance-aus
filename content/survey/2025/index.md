      text: |-

        Understanding public beliefs and expectations about artificial intelligence (AI) risks and their possible responses is important for ensuring that the ethical, legal, and social implications of AI are addressed through effective governance.

        The *Survey Assessing Risks from AI* (SARA) generates 'evidence for action', to help public and private actors make the decisions needed for safer AI development and use.

        This survey investigates public concerns about different risks from AI, public support for AI development and regulation, and priority governance actions to address risks from AI (with a focus on government action).

        We recruit a representative sample of Australians through online quota sampling stratified by age, sex, and Australian state / territory. We conduct multilevel regression with poststratification to construct more accurate population estimates based on Australian Census data.
