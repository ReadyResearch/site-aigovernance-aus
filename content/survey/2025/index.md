        Understanding Australian public views on AI risks and governance
        
        We conducted a representative survey of 933 Australian adults to understand public perceptions of AI risks and support for AI governance actions in Australia.

        **2025 Survey** (933 Australians): Australians expect AI to be as safe as commercial aviation - at least **4,000x** safer than current risk estimates. They want the government to better manage AI risks, and many risk controls would increase their trust in AI.

      title: What This Means for Australia
      text: |-
        **Safety standards matter**: Australians hold AI to the same rigorous safety standards as commercial aviation. This means they expect AI systems to cause fewer than 1 death per 100 million hours of operation—far stricter than current AI safety benchmarks.

        **Public trust depends on action**: The research shows that implementing appropriate risk controls would directly increase trust in AI technology. This presents a clear pathway for both government and industry.

        **Governance framework needed**: With strong public support for government action on AI risks, there is a mandate for developing comprehensive AI governance frameworks that address current harms and potential catastrophic risks.

      title: How We Conducted This Survey
      text: |-

        We recruited 1,141 Australians through online representative quota sampling stratified by age, sex, and Australian state / territory. We also conducted multilevel regression with poststratification to construct more accurate population estimates based on 2021 Australian Census data.
